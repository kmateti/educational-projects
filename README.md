# Educational Projects

This repository develops interactive educational projects that aim to spark interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics (STEAM) subjects. Projects should touch  multiple components of [visual, auditory, and kinaesthetic](https://engage-education.com/us/blog/vak-learning-styles-what-are-they-and-what-do-they-mean-engage-education/) learning styles. Creating genuinely interactive projects with a tie in to a real-world application is challenging, but [critical](https://www.educationcorner.com/the-learning-pyramid/) to increased retention of information.

## Projects

1. [Depth Camera Piano](./docs/depth-camera-piano.md): This project uses a depth camera (like the Intel RealSense D435i) to sense the distance away from four virtual rays. Based on the minimum sensed distance of each ray, a musical note plays. This forms a virtual instrument that enables four independent "voices" to make music simultaneously. The lesson that follows touches on how stereoscopic depth cameras work, image and video processing, geometry, music theory, and programming.


## Use of AI

Aritificial Intelligence tools like Github copilot were certainly used in developing these projects, but a few guiding principles should be discussed up front. There is no shortcut to critically evaluating the output of AI tools, and there is no shortcut to "plug everything together" and test. The thought process of 1) determining the problem statement, and 2) breaking the problem down into systems and subsystems that need to work together is still necessary. Writing a clear, complete AI prompt actually helps clarify the problem statement, the inputs, and the intended outcome. AI tools are rapidly evolving, but blindly accepting AI changes without critical review can quickly break existing systems. Part of these educational projects will include a note on how AI was used to iterate towards a solution.
